# YAML-Placer
YAML Obstacle Placer - Add this to your project and call it's functions to place obstacles!

Can place both Walls and Targets

All you need to do is pass a reference to your window.

As it stands, you WILL need to have your obstacles: in your YAML file at the very end, otherwise this won't work.
