# YAML-Placer
YAML Obstacle Placer - Add this to your project and call it's functions to place obstacles!

Can place both Walls and Targets

All you need to do is pass a reference to your window.

As it stands, you WILL need to have your obstacles: in your YAML file at the very end, otherwise this won't work.

HOW TO USE:

Take the YAMLPlacer.h and YAMLPlacer.cpp, add them to your Visual Studio Project.
Include YAMLPlacer.h in the appropriate spot (usually within your Game.h so you can pass the RenderWindow).

YOU WILL NEED SFML IN ORDER TO USE THIS!
